# Geolocation Api

### Let's get started.

```
cd geolocation-api
```

First of all install `pipenv`
using command

```
pip install --user pipenv
```

`Pipenv` is used to create a `virtual environment` which isolates the python packages you used in this project from other system python packages. So, that you can have a different version of same python packages for different projects.

Now, let's install `packages` using `pipenv`

```
pipenv shell
```

To start the server run:

```
flask run
```
